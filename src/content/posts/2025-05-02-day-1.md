# Day 1/365 of building 12 startups in 12 months

Today was about translating commitment into first steps.

As I was saying yesterday, the focus was completely on the 12-month plan.
I have to refine a lot of things before I start building.
You need to use your imagination a lot for this and be productive at the same time.
I will not give you the story that it will be easy.

So I spent the whole day on:

1. Analyzed and studied **@starter_story** and **@levelsio**:
   - During these 365 days I will 100% need to use cursor to launch startups and code, that's why I was watching **@starter_story**'s yt video for vide coding.
   - ➝ Confirmed that cursor will be essential for the AI-assisted coding workflow
   - At the same time I was deep researching **@levelsio**
   - Because it's an inspiration for me and everything I can discover from him is gold for my journey.
   - Key lesson from **@levelsio** deep-dive:
     ➝ Speed comes from solving *your own* problems first. ➝ Reminder to self: keep startup n.1 focused on a real pain point I understand.

2. Twitter management will be key, I've decided to keep this format "day x/365 of.." because it's the best one for me to tell you my journey and the backstage of it. But at the same time I don't want to do just one post, I'd like to push more value.

3. TikTok research.
   - I had to do market research a lot for this. I'm not an expert of the field but if I want to grow there and create a faceless figure like I am, I need to understand what works and what doesn't.

4. Brainstormed some ideas.
   - It takes time to have a concrete idea, I don't want to just push a startup just because a light is turning on in my mind.
   - ➝ Generating ideas is easy, validating them is hard.
   - Today I was trying to draft prompts for quick problem validation. But I'm still hunting for the final form.

Feeling the challenge, but the process is moving.
