# Day 0/365 of building 12 startups in 12 months.

After creating my socials and sharing my story yesterday, today was about getting my mind clear and setting the foundation for the next 365 days.

First thing I had to do was to build a plan, a solid 12-month roadmap with real long-term goals baked in.  
Then, I started brainstorming ideas for the first month because I didn't show up here with something ready to launch, but with something to build from 0.  
These first few days are for market research.

Every startup or digital product I launch will come from three places:

1. problems I personally experience in different fields  
2. real frustrations people already face (and talk about) in those spaces  
3. things I like  

And that's because you should never build something you don’t understand and appreciate the value.  
If you don’t live it, don’t ship it.

So the next steps will be:

- brainstorming  
- market research for potential problems people face  
- validate the ideas  
- find solutions and outline the initial scope for the very first projects  

See you tomorrow.
